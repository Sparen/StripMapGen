# Strip Map Generator

This is a specification and generator for simple strip maps. This repository has an associated [GitHub pages website](https://sparen.github.io/StripMapGen/).

# Features

* Dynamic placement of stations based on number of stations
* Customizable station icons
* Support for SVG icons
* Support for multiple lines of text

# Setup

To use this tool, we recommend downloading one of our (future) releases and including it in a webpage where you want to embed a map.

You will need to also include JavaScript containing the data structures containing the line and icon information.

Alternatively, you can use a CDN, but this is currently discouraged due to the rapidly changing nature of the specification.
