      <div>Welcome to the website for this project - a SVG and JSON-based Strip Map Generator. This project aims to provide a way to generate strip maps from a JSON file, with no need for a vector graphics editor such as Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape (though those tools are, of course, much more powerful). The main advantage of this tool is the ability to change a few parameters in a JSON file and have live updates on a website.</div>
      <div>Please note that Strip Maps generated by this tool are inevitably going to be extremely simple without knowledge of the Scalable Vector Graphics format. This tool is a work in progress.</div>
      <br>
      
      <div>The project repository can be found on <a href="https://github.com/Sparen/StripMapGen">GitHub</a>. You can find the example projects here as well as documentation.</div>
      <div>Example Strip Maps generated using this tool:<br>
	<a href="./test-network/test-network.html">Test Network</a><br>
	<a href="./test-helsinki/test-helsinki.html">Helsinki Metro</a>
      </div>
      <div>In the future, documentation is expected to be migrated from the repository README to a webpage. In addition, a user guide is under construction.</div>
      <br>

      <div>If you are using this tool in a serious setting (e.g. the maps generated by this tool are *actually* being used in production), <strong>please let me know</strong>. Since this tool is still in its early stages, things are breaking and the specification is changing every few days or so. If you *do* want to use this tool in a production setting at the moment, I highly advise exporting the generated SVG itself rather than hooking into the library to generate the map on the fly from your JavaScript. In the future, there may be proper releases that users can hook into, but for now no such releases exist.</div>
      <div>Note that while this project aims to generate all kinds of strip maps, full support for Top-Down languages such as Chinese and Japanese is unlikely to occur as it would overcomplicate the existing specification.</div>
